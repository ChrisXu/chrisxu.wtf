            <h4>Hi there,</h4>
            <p>I'm Chris from Taiwan<span role="img" aria-label="taiwan">ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼</span>, a software engineer and Swift bartender in Amsterdam. I make mobile applications and development tools for living. I also like to build teams and engineer culture for fun.</p>

            <p>In the daytime, I enjoy reading books with classical music. At night, I turn into coding with electronic music. If you hear lo-fi music in my house, I am probably cooking.</p>

            <p>Sometimes people find me boring because I tend to speak objectively, which is too plain to understand. I do have biases on many things, but I try to eliminate those in my posts and talks. So please do feel free to hit me up, and also all kind of feedback is much appreciated.</p>
