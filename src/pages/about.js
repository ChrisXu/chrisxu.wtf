            <p>Hi there,</p>
            <p>
              How is your day? What kind of curiosity brings you here? Anyway, nice to meet you.
              I'm Chris from Taiwan🇹🇼, living in Amsterdam, unavoidably being a cyclist for a few years. 
              I build apps, teach people code, and read books. 
            </p>
          </section>
        </main>
      </Layout>
